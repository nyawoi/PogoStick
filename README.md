# Pogo Stick for Staxel

Pogo Stick is a work-in-progress client-side single-player mod for Staxel. It allows players to continuously bounce slightly higher than normal without having to jump. At the moment, a whistle is used as a pogo stick substitute.

## Using the Pogo Stick

With your pogo stick equipped in hand, simply jump once and you'll begin to bounce upon landing. To stop bouncing, hold down the sneak key.

## Current Mod Limitations

At the moment, it seems servers are not able to apply forces to player entities' physics controller. This restricts the mod to be client-side only. Without an adequate fallback, the mod's main use will be in single-player worlds.

## Issues

- [ ] The player can time their jump, increasing the bounce height
